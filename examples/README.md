# Example Workflows

These workflows were generated by an AI agent (Claude Code) and committed directly to the repository. On startup, n8n-starter imports them automatically.

## basic-webhook-responder.json

Webhook that receives a POST request, transforms the body (uppercases the message field, adds a timestamp and word count), and responds with the result.

Flow: `Webhook -> Transform -> Respond to Webhook`

Test with:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:12001/webhook/transform \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "hello from curl"}'
```

## scheduled-system-check.json

Cron job that runs every 5 minutes, hits n8n's own `/healthz` endpoint, formats a status report, and branches on success or failure.

Flow: `Schedule Trigger -> HTTP Request -> Format Status -> If -> Log Success / Log Failure`

No external services needed -- it monitors n8n itself inside the docker network.

## Usage

Copy any JSON file to `packages/n8n/workflows/` and run:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

The init container imports all workflows on startup. To activate a workflow, set `"active": true` in the JSON or toggle it in the n8n UI.
