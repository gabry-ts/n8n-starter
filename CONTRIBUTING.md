# Contributing

We welcome contributions! Here's how to get started.

## Workflow

1. **Fork** the repository on GitHub
2. **Create a branch** from `main` for your changes: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature`
3. **Make your changes** following the conventions outlined in [CLAUDE.md](./CLAUDE.md)
4. **Push** your branch and **open a Pull Request** to `main`

## Code Conventions
